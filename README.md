The Aggressively Annoying UI

This is a proof-of-concept web interface designed to create maximum user frustration through a series of hostile and counter-intuitive design choices.
It utilizes modern web technologies (HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript) along with the Gemini API's Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature to deliver an aggressively annoying user experience.

Hostile Features Implemented

The interface is built to actively discourage interaction through the following mechanisms:
TTS Hostility: The system voice (TTS via the Gemini API) engages the user only upon interaction (initial load, or clicking the main button), delivering stern and contemptuous remarks before automatically silencing itself.
The Fleeing Button: The primary "CLICK ME" button actively attempts to escape the user's cursor upon approach (hover), and shifts randomly when clicked.
Perpetual Failure Loading Bar: A "CRITICAL SYSTEM DOWNLOAD" bar progresses to 99%, stalls indefinitely, flashes an error message, and then resets, trapping the user in a loop of perpetual near-completion.
Inverted Scroll: The vertical scroll wheel direction is inverted, making navigation extremely disorienting.
Reversed Input: Text typed into the main input field is immediately reversed, forcing the user to type backwards to see the correct forward-typed text.
Layout Shifting: The entire content container subtly jitters and shifts position randomly to disrupt focus and interaction rhythm.
Infinite Maze Navigation: The navigation links lead to a warning that the user is trapped in a loop and there is no escape.
